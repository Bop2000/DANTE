# Evaluations on synthetic functions using surrogate model

We run extensive tests on well-known non-convex functions (Ackley, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock) of diverse types using surrogate model predictions and compare the performance of DANTE with other state-of-the-art algorithms. DANTE-based methods outperform other benchmark methods.
