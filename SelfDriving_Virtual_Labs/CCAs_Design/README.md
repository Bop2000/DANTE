# Pipeline

**To run the self-driving laboratory for compositionally complex alloy design using DANTE, see `DANTE_VL_CCAs_Design.ipynb` for detailed instruction**

**Note:** If you can not open it in Github, please download it.

To have a quick start, please run the following line in terminal:

```shell
bash run.sh
```
**Note:** The environment name should be replaced by yours in `run.sh`. You can change the number of iteration by replace `1` in `python3 run.py --iter 1`

1) Introduction to this notebook a.k.a multi-component alloy design
2) Scope -> optimizing the electric properties (aha and ahc) by desiging the composition
3) whats new -> helper functions to generate valid compositinon (external constraints); multi-objective
4) Note: No validation source included
5) Results and results from supplements (a.k.a progress plots)
